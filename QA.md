## Quick Test Commands

```bash
# Check for TypeScript errors
npm run type-check

# Run linting
npm run lint

# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server locally
npm start
```

## Emergency Rollback

If issues are found in production:

1. Revert problematic commit: `git revert [commit-sha]`
2. Push to main: `git push origin main`
3. Verify Vercel auto-deploys the revert
4. Check BuildInfo badge shows reverted SHA
5. Test critical paths work correctly
